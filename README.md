# Sudoku Solver with Visualizer

This program uses recursion to solve any Sudoku puzzle by brute force.  The puzzle starts at the first empty cell and tries all possible numbers 1-9.  If a number is valid, it moves on to the next cell.  If the program hits a dead end (no valid numbers can be entered in a cell), it will backtrack and try again with the next number.  This tool also gives the option to visualize the process with three different speed settings.
